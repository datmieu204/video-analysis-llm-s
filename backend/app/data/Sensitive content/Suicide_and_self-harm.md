YouTube users should not be afraid to speak openly about the topics of mental health, suicide, self-harm, and eating disorders in a supportive and non-harmful way.

However, there are times when content is created that is sensitive and may pose a risk for some users. When you create content that contains suicide, self-harm, or eating disorder related topics, take into account the possible negative impact of your content on other users, especially minors and users who may be sensitive to this content.

To protect and support your viewers and other users, please follow the Community Guidelines below when creating content related to suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders. Not following these Community Guidelines may result in a strike, removal of your content, or other restrictions to protect users. [Learn more](/youtube/topic/9387060) Learn more .

This Community Guidelines policy applies to videos, video descriptions, comments, live streams, and any other YouTube product or feature.Keep in mind that this isn't a complete list.

### Best practices for creators posting content about suicide, self-harm, or eating disorders

We recommend using these best practices in content related to suicide or self-harm to protect your viewers from harm and distress:

- Avoid showing the person who died by suicide, and respect their, and their families’, privacy. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/2801895) Learn more .
- Use wording that is positive and supportive, and focuses on recovery, prevention, and stories of hope.
- Include information and resources for suicide and self-harm prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.
- Do not use sensationalist language or dramatic visuals.
- Provide context, but avoid discussing how the victim died by suicide. Do not mention the methods or locations.
- Blur content that contains images of suicide victims. You can blur your video with the Editor in YouTube Studio. [Learn more](/youtube/answer/9057652) Learn more .

We recommend using these best practices in content related to eating disorders to protect your viewers from harm and distress:

- Focus on the impact of the disorder instead of the details of the disordered eating behavior.
- Tell your audience that eating disorders commonly cause severe complications.
- Include info and resources for eating disorder prevention and coping strategies. Try to include it in both the video itself and the description of the video.

## What happens if content violates this policy

If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.

If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the option to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning may not expire and your channel may be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.

If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel may be terminated. Learn more about [our strikes system](/youtube/answer/2802032) our strikes system .

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about [channel or account terminations](/youtube/answer/2802168) channel or account terminations .

Finally we may also limit your access to live streaming if you suggest that you’ll live stream content that will violate our Community Guidelines. [Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.](/youtube/answer/2853834?hl=en) Learn more about restrictions on live streaming.
