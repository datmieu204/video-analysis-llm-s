Our Community Guidelines aim to make YouTube a safer community. Sometimes, content that would otherwise violate our [Community Guidelines](https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/policies/community-guidelines/#community-guidelines) Community Guidelines may stay on YouTube when it has Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic (EDSA) context. In these cases, the content gets an EDSA exception. This article has tips for how you can add context—more information that informs or educates viewers—to your EDSA content.

## How content gets an EDSA exception

We assess whether content gets an EDSA exception on a case-by-case basis. First, we check if there’s a Community Guidelines violation in the content. If there’s a violation, we review if there’s enough context in the content to make an EDSA exception. We review **WHAT** WHAT context is present and **WHERE** WHERE the context is.

## What context to add to your EDSA content

The type of context you must include to get an EDSA exception depends on what’s in the content.

We make most EDSA exceptions when content has one or more of the following:

1. **Basic facts about what’s happening in the content:** Basic facts about what’s happening in the content: Identify who’s in the content, describe what the content shows or when and where it takes place, or explain why certain content is present.

## Examples of basic facts

Basic facts are especially helpful when content is [violent or graphic](/youtube/answer/2802008) violent or graphic or shows [nudity or sex](/youtube/answer/2802002) nudity or sex . This content may be less harmful to viewers when there’s context.

These examples illustrate content that’s more likely and less likely to get an EDSA exception:

2. **Condemnation, opposing views, or satire:** Condemnation, opposing views, or satire: Communicate that your content condemns certain claims, includes opposing points of view, or is satirical.

3. **Discouragement of dangerous behavior:** Discouragement of dangerous behavior: Tell viewers not to imitate what’s in the video.

## Examples of discouraging dangerous behavior

**Note:** Note: The above examples aren't a complete list of the context that you can add to your EDSA content. When in doubt, add multiple forms of context to your EDSA content. To help prevent content from causing harm, include the info in your video, not just your video’s title or description.

When in doubt, include different types of context described above: basic factual information that explains what’s in your content, multiple points of view, and clear and informative discouragement against imitating dangerous or harmful behavior. Be sure to include this information in the content itself, like the video or audio, to help avoid the content potentially causing harm.

In some cases, we may make EDSA exceptions to allow certain content based on public interest. This could include, for example, content like national political candidates on the campaign trail, graphic footage from active warzones or humanitarian crises, or comments disputing health authority guidance made during a public hearing. We may apply an [age restriction](/youtube/answer/2802167) age restriction or warning to content even if it gets an EDSA exception because it may not be appropriate for viewers under 18 (e.g. violent crime footage in a documentary).

## WHERE to add context to your EDSA content

You can add context to your:

- Video For example, you can add footage or text overlays.
- Audio For example, you can add narration including condemnation or a countervailing point of view.
- Video title
- Video description

**What about other types of content, like comments?** What about other types of content, like comments?
