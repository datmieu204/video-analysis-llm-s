## What these policies mean for you

#### If you're posting content

Don’t post content on YouTube if it fits any of the descriptions noted below.

- **Channel impersonation:** Channel impersonation: A channel that copies another channel's profile, background, or overall look and feel in such a way that makes it look like someone else's channel. The channel does not have to be 100% identical, as long as the intent is clear to copy the other channel.
- **Personal impersonation:** Personal impersonation: Content intended to look like someone else is posting it.

If you operate a fan channel, make sure you state so explicitly in your channel name or [handle](/youtube/answer/11585688) handle . It should be obvious to your viewers that your channel doesn't represent the original creator, artist or entity your channel is celebrating.

## Examples

Here are some examples of content that’s not allowed on YouTube.

- Channels with the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image as another channel, with the only difference being a space inserted into the name or a zero replacing the letter O.
- Using someone else's real name, user name, image, brand, logo, or other personal information to trick people into believing you are that person.
- Setting up a channel using the same identifier (channel name or handle) and image of a person, and then pretending that person is posting content to the channel.
- Setting up a channel using the name and image of a person, and then posting comments on other channels as if they were posted by the person.
- Channels claiming to be a 'fan account' in the channel description, but not stating so clearly in the channel name or handle, or posing as another’s channel and reuploading their content.
- Channels impersonating an existing news channel.

Remember these are just some examples, and don't post content if you think it might violate this policy.
